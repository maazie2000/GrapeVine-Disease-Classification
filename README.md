This notebbok, works on creating 3 modeling experiments to create the best model for identifying the type of grapevine disease, given the image. The accuracy score recieved by the best model was 98%.

## About Grapevine disease
Grape vine diseases are serious threats to vineyards and homegrown grapes all over the world, and could be devastating to your plant, its fruit production, and winemaking. Not only is it heartbreaking to lose a plant you’ve been nurturing for however much time you’ve had it, but grape vine diseases can also impact small economies that depend on grape production for a variety of different products. Most grape vine diseases can be blamed on bacteria, fungi, and viruses, which spread easily through pest damage.

## Modeling Experiments
Here are all the experiments that were run :-
- `model0` :- Creating a simple Convolutional neural network model
- `model1` :- Creating a Convolutional neural network model with data augmentation
- `model2` :- Create a EfficientNetV2B0 feature extraction transfer learning model

All of the following experiments were run using tensorflow.

## Conclusion
Updates to make:-
- More experiments
- Bigger Dataset
